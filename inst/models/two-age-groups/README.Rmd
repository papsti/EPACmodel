### "two-age-group" model

This version of the model features a basic epidemiological structure stratified with two age groups: young and old. The epidemiological compartments are:

- $S$: susceptible
- $E$: exposed
- $I$: infected
- $H$: hospitalized
- $R$: recovered
- $D$: dead

The flows within each age group are as follows:

```


The solid lines indicate flows between compartments and the dashed lines indicate when a compartment is involved in calculating a flow rate.
